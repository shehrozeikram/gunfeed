              <h2>FAQ</h2>
              <p>
                <b>I live in California, can I purchase a firearm?</b>
              </p>
              <p>Yes, but
                <b>handguns and rifles are heavily restricted in CA.</b> If the firearm does not appear on
                <a target="_blank" href="#">State of California's Department of Justice Roster of Handguns Certified for Sale</a>, the seller cannot ship it to California. It is up to you to ensure that the rifle or shotgun is permitted for sale in your state.
              </p>
              <p>Firearms that are shipping to California with the magazine capacity greater than 10 will ship without any magazines unless the firearm is stated as being California Compliant.</p>
              <p>
                <i>If you purchase a firearm that is not legal for sale in the state of California you will be refunded your purchase amount, minus a restocking fee.</i>
